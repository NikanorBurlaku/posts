This project is a web application for managing posts. In the application, users can view, create, edit, and delete posts. Each post consists of a title and content. The main functions of the project include:

**Displaying a list of posts**: Users can view a list of all available posts. Each post is displayed with its title and a brief summary of its content.

**Adding a new post**: Users can create new posts by entering a title and content for each one. After creating a post, it is automatically added to the list.

**Editing an existing post**: Users have the ability to change the title and content of existing posts. When selecting a specific post, a modal editing window opens, allowing users to make necessary changes.

**Deleting a post**: Users can delete any post from the list. A confirmation dialog appears when deleting to prevent accidental removal.

**Pagination**: Pagination is used to manage a large volume of posts. Users can navigate between pages to view additional posts.

**Searching and sorting**: Users can search posts by title and content, as well as sort them by various criteria such as creation date or title.

**Error handling**: In case of errors during post operations, users receive notifications with error information and instructions for resolution.

This project is a simple yet effective web application for managing posts, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with content.
